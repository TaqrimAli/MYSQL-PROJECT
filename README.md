# MYSQL-PROJECT
This project contains a database to showcase my knowledge of MySQL.

# NOTE
- Install and follow the guide of mysql workbench to see the database here:
- https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/
- Create a new query tab and copy and paste the mysql code there. 
- Don't forget to use reverse engineer underneath the database tab in mysql workbench to get a visual representation of my code.
